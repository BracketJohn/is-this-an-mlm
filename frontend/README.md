# Frontend

Webapp that provides all the UI/UX of `isthisanmlm.com`.

## Development

Install `npm` and `node`, then run:
```sh
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

to start the application in development mode. Export the environment variable `BACKEND_BASE_URL` to talk to a different origin backend (e.g., `localhost:8001` of the backend API).
