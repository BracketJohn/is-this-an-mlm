# is-this-an-mlm

Website to determine whether a company is an mlm. It currently runs [here](https://isthisanmlm.com) and is referenced by multiple websites, videos and people as a help to determine whether a company is a multilevel marketing (MLM) company.

Multilevel marketing companies often prey on their members. I decided to create this site as a help for the community in order to tackle these harmful schemes. It is developed out in the open to keep it open and transparent.

The main source of MLMs is the `antiMLM` reddit community and the visitors of the page themselves (as they can submit companies by themselves).

## Deployment

Install `docker` and `docker-compose`. Then run:
```sh
> docker-compose up
```

## Development

For development instructions, please have a look at the `README.md`s in each individual service directory.
